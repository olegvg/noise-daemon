Noise Daemon
============

There are two backend daemons which could be decided as example of following Python technologies and frameworks:

>- gevent
>- Flask
>- WebSocket
>- NumPy and some light math based on Fast Fourier Transform
>- supervisord

It's only an example of Python power in asynchronous data processing in IO-bound tasks. The example illustrates that despite of Python's GIL even some CPU-bound code can be processed using gevent and gevent-like frameworks and it could be useful in some circumstances.
